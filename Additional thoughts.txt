Ok, so I have the config for the logic circuit (logic for whole thing)
and now I need the interface between the SPI, the LCD, and the WEB

Process:

Read in values from SPI
using some sort of config, place those values in an array
This array is concurrent, and always is available
Values from Web are asynchronously added to the array

array is processed in the circuit

using the config, outputs to the web, spi, and lcd are declared





Config file will determine:
	Logic Circuit to use
	Web Interface to use
	Number of LCDs
	Mappings from SPI-in and WEB-in to Circuit-in
	Mappings from Circuit-out to SPI-out, WEB-out, and LCD-out


Or should I just do some sort of hard coded thing for right now?
